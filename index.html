            <li> <strong>1914</strong> - Born in Cresco, lowal
            </li>
            <li> <strong>1933</strong> - Leaves his family's farm to attend the University of Minnesota, <br>
                thanks to a Depression era program known as the "National Youth <br>
                Administration"
            </li> 
            <li><strong>1935</strong>  - Has to stop school and save up more money. Works in the Civilian <br>
                Conservation Corps, helping starving Americans. "I saw how food changed <br>
    them", he said. "All of this left scars on me."  
            </li>
            <li><strong>1937</strong>  - Finishes university and takes a job in the US Forestry Service</li> 
            <li><strong>1938</strong> - Marries wife of 69 years Margret Gibson. Gets laid off due to budget <br>
                cuts. Inspired by Elvin Charles Stakman, he returns to school study under <br>
    Stakman, who teaches him about breeding pest-resistent plants.</li>    
            <li><strong>1941</strong> - Tries to enroll in the military after the Pearl Harbor attack, but is <br>
                rejected. Instead, the military asked his lab to work on waterproof glue, DDT <br>
    to control malaria, disinfectants, and other applied science. </li>
            <li><strong>1942</strong>  - Receives a Ph.D. in Genetics and Plant Pathology </li>
            <li> <strong>1944</strong> - Rejects a 100% salary increase from Dupont, leaves behind his <br>
                pregnant wife, and flies to Mexico to head a new plant pathology program. <br>
                Over the next 16 years, his team breeds 6,000 different strains of disease <br>
                resistent wheat - including different varieties for each major climate on <br>
                Earth.  </li>
            <li><strong>1945</strong>  - Discovers a way to grown wheat twice each season, doubling wheat <br>
                yields   </li>
            <li> <strong>1953</strong> - crosses a short, sturdy dwarf breed of wheat with a high-yeidling <br>
                American breed, creating a strain that responds well to fertilizer. It goes on <br>
    to provide 95% of Mexico's wheat
            </li>
            <li> <strong>1962</strong> - Visits Delhi and brings his high-yielding strains of wheat to the <br>
                Indian subcontinent in time to help mitigate mass starvation due to a rapidly <br>
    expanding population
    
            </li>
            <li><strong>1970</strong> - receives the Nobel Peace Prize</li>
            <li><strong>1983</strong> - helps seven African countries dramatically increase their maize and <br>sorghum yields</li>
            <li><strong>1984</strong> - becomes a distinguished professor at Texas A&M University</li>
            <li><strong>2005</strong> - states "we will have to double the world food supply by 2050." <br>
                Argues that genetically modified crops are the only way we can meet the <br>
                demand, as we run out of arable land. Says that GM crops are not inherently <br>
                dangerous because "we've been genetically modifying plants and animals <br>
                for a long time. Long before we called it science, people were selecting the <br>

    best breeds."</li>
            <li><strong>2009</strong> - dies at the age of 95.</li>
        </ul>
